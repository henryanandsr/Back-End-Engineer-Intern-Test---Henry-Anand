# Back End Engineer Intern Test - Henry Anand

## Encode Baju
The encodeBaju function is implemented in JavaScript and takes three inputs: the selling price limit, the ideal selling price, and the price offered by the customer. The function returns one of the following strings:
1. If the customer's offered price is less than the selling price limit:
`"REJECT, belum balik modal nih!"`
2. If the customer's offered price is greater than or equal to the selling price limit but less than the ideal selling price:
`"ACCEPT, terima kasih sudah berbelanja"`
3. If the customer's offered price is equal to the ideal selling price:
`"GOOD, customer terbaik gak pake nawar"`

- Raw solution code has been written in javascript at `./1. EncodingFunction/encode.js`
